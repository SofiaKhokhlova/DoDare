# Features:

- **Personalized tasks:** Users can create their tasks, and define their description, and the number of points. This allows each user to tailor the application to their needs and goals.

- **Rewards and Item Store:** For completing tasks, users earn points that can be spent in the Item Store to purchase virtual goods for their character (avatar). This creates additional motivation to complete tasks and achieve goals.

- **Groups and cooperative tasks:** Users can create groups or join existing ones, where they can interact with other members, share experiences, and help each other achieve goals. Group administrators can create tasks that will be available to all group members.
